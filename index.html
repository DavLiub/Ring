            <h2>Book I: The Ring Sets Out</h2>
            <p class="history">
                Gandalf proves that Frodo's Ring is the One Ring by throwing it into Frodo's fireplace, revealing the hidden
                text of the Rhyme of the Rings.
                Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to
                Frodo Baggins, his cousin[e] and heir. Neither Hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but the wizard Gandalf
                suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in "The Shadow of the Past", Gandalf confirms to
                Frodo that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels Frodo to take it away from
                the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany Frodo on his journey, but
                fails to do so.
                Frodo sets out on foot, offering a cover story of moving to Crickhollow, accompanied by his gardener Sam
                Gamgee and Frodo's cousin Pippin Took. They are pursued by mysterious Black Riders, but meet a passing group
                of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders. The Hobbits spend the
                night with them, then take an evasive shortcut the next day, and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot, who
                takes them to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. When they reach the house at
                Crickhollow, Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on travelling with Frodo and Sam.
                They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are
                trapped by Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who controls much of the forest, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil.
                Leaving the refuge of Tom's house, they get lost in a fog and are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on
                the downs, but Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and equips
                them with ancient swords from the barrow-wight's hoard.
                The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider. The innkeeper gives
                Frodo a letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the
                riders will attempt to seize the party, Strider guides the Hobbits through the wilderness toward the Elven
                sanctuary of Rivendell. On the way, the group stops at Weathertop, a hill. While there, they are again
                attacked, though by only five of the nine Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. After
                fighting them off, Strider treats Frodo with the herb athelas, and is joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who has
                been searching for the party. Glorfindel rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, toward Rivendell. The Black
                Riders pursue Frodo, but when they enter the Ford of Bruinen, they are swept away by flood waters summoned
                by Elrond.
